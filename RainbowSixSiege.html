<h3>Rainbow Six Siege</h3>
<h1>How it started</h1>
<p> I used to play the video game <b>Rainbow Six Siege</b> for about 5 years before I decided to call it quits. <b>Rainbow Six Siege</b> came out in late 2015 and I was one of the few people to pickup the beta and start to play it. I played on Xbox when it was very popular and I played it when it wasn't very popular. I went from playing on weekend tournaments and leagues to not even owning an xbox anymore(switched to PC).
<h1>Where it ended</h1>
<p>I had a group of three friends, including me, who played almost everyday for about a year at the highest level in the game. That was the start of the downfall and how the game became very boring.
